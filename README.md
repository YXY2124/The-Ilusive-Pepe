<p>To use the bot, go into the <b>.env</b> file and enter your <b>bot token</b></p>
<p>Then do <b>npm i</b> then <b>npm i discord.js --save</b></p>
<p>Next you'll do these last node.js things to get the bt running. If your still having errors, join my Discord server!  <a href="https://discord.gg/wkH2ccp">The Illusive Pepe Official</a>
